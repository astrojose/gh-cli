### Github CLI Demonstration
Am supper happy to learn this tool as I've been annoyed with the continuous switching between code editor, terminal and browser while working with issues and pull requests. 

This tool is lit, I just love it. 

### Useful Commands

`gh repo create # here we create a github repository.`

`gh repo view # view the readme.md of the current repo` 

`gh repo fork # fork the with a given url`
